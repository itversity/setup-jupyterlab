    "## Jupyter Lab and Postgresql on Ubuntu VM\n",

    "Let us go through the steps related to integrating Jupyter Lab with Postgresql on Ubuntu VM.\n",
    "* Using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook is optional. You can leverage SQL Workbench or `psql` to practice. However, using `psql` is a bit tricky and can take away considerable amount of time.\n",
    "* We need additional libraries to be setup as part of Jupyter environment for integrating Notebooks with Postgres to write queries with out writing any code. Before getting into setup let us understand the pre-requisites.\n",
    "  * You should have Python3 installed.\n",
    "  * Also you should have setup Jupyter Lab environment by now. If not you can follow our [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf0swTFhTI8qOGXb3e6BmqHGQ-tnsP51q) for the same. You will get step by step instructions to setup Jupyter Lab on Ubuntu VM on GCP using Docker.\n",
    "* Once Jupyter Lab is setup we need to install the following to leverage Jupyter based notebooks to practice SQL.\n",
    "  * You need to install `ipython-sql` library using `pip` with in the virtual environment used to setup Jupyter Lab.\n",
    "  * Activate the virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "cd delab\n",
    "source delab-venv/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Here are the instructions to setup Postgresql on Ubuntu. You can get latest instructions from this [link](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/).\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "sudo sh -c 'echo \"deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list'\n",
    "\n",
    "wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -\n",
    "\n",
    "sudo apt-get update\n",
    "sudo apt-get -y install postgresql-common\n",
    "```\n",
    "* You also need to install **SQL Alchemy** to facilitate the connectivity between Jupyter Notebooks and the databases. However, it will be installed along with `ipython-sql`. You can run `pip list` to validate whether **SQL Alchemy** is installed or not.\n",
    "  * Also we need to install `psycopg2` to connect to Postgres database.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip install ipython-sql\n",
    "pip list\n",
    "pip install psycopg2-binary\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make sure the Postgres database in docker is running fine. If not, start the docker container.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "docker ps -a\n",
    "docker start itv_pg\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Let us also create a demo database to validate the connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "docker exec -it itv_pg psql -U postgres\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE DATABASE demo_db;\n",
    "CREATE USER demo_user WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'demo_password';\n",
    "GRANT ALL ON DATABASE demo_db TO demo_user;\n",
    "\n",
    "\\q\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Start jupyter lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "jupyter lab --ip 0.0.0.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Now it is time for us to connect to Jupyter Lab using browser and validate.\n",
    "* Once all the libraries are installed, we need to load sql extension and then create environment variable called as `DATABASE_URL` using all the connectivity information.\n",
    "* We can run a query to validate that we are connected to the database."
